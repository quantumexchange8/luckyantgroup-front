                    <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">Initial margin is the percentage of the purchase price of a security that must be covered by cash or collateral when using a margin account. In order for you to transact business in Futures and Options, 
                        you must first post a certain amount of cash, securities or other collateral to satisfy the initial margin requirements. This process allows for magnification of potential profits but also magnifies potential losses.</p>

                    <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">The term collateral refers to an asset that a lender accepts as security for a transaction and acts as a form of protection for the lender by ensuring that should you be unable to maintain your financial obligations, the lender can seize the collateral.

                    <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">A trade in one of our markets is a trade based on movements in the price of the relevant and/or underlying instrument. Whether you make a profit or a loss will depend on the prices we set and fluctuations in the underlying instrument to which your trade 
                        relates.Trades in our products can only be settled in cash and are legally enforceable.
                    </p>
                    <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">In certain circumstances your losses on a trade may be unlimited. For instance, if you open a position with us to sell the contract in question (a practice known as “shorting a market”) and the price rises, you will make a loss on that trade and it’ s impossible to know the limit of your potential 
                        losses until you close the trade or your open positions are closed when your margin level reaches the margin close out level. You must ensure that you understand the potential consequences of a particular product or trade and be prepared to accept that degree of risk. You may be called upon to deposit 
                        substantial additional margin, at short notice, to maintain your position. If you do not provide such additional funds within the time required, your position may be closed at a loss and you will be liable for any resulting deficit.You will not acquire the underlying instrument or any rights of delivery 
                        obligations to the underlying instrument.
                    </p>      
                    <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">Certain markets are quoted and settled in currencies other than your base currency.Trading in these markets carries the additional risk of currency risk, as the exchange rate at the time your positions are closed and converted into your base currency, maybe different to the rate at the time you created 
                        the open position.</p>

Gapping may occur in fast and falling markets or if price sensitive information is realised prior to market opening. The price at which Lucky Ant Trading executes your orders may be adversely affected if gapping occurs in the relevant market. Stop loss orders will be executed when the price meets or exceeds your specified order price.

If there is a significant reduction or a temporary or permanent cessation in liquidity in an underlying instrument, such events may be deemed an event outside of Lucky Ant Trading’ s control or market disruption event (where applicable) and Lucky Ant Trading may increase the spread between the bid and offer, suspend trading or take any other action considered reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, you may not be able to place trades or to close or open positions in any affected market.

                <h4>Dealing in shares may involve the following specific risks :</h4>
                  <ol style=" list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                    <li class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta uk-margin-bottom"> Company risk: a share purchaser does not lend funds to the company, but makes a capital contribution and, as such takes an ownership interest in the corporation. It is difficult to forecast the precise yield on such an investment.An extreme case would be if the company went bankrupt, thereby wiping out the total sums invested.</li>
                    <li  class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta uk-margin-bottom"> Price risk: share prices may undergo unforeseeable price fluctuations causing risks of loss. Price increases and decreases in short-medium and long-term alternate without it being possible to determine the duration of those cycles.General market must be distinguished from the specific risk attached to the company itself. Both risks, jointly or in aggregate, influence evolution of share prices.</li>
                    <li  class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">Dividend risk: the dividend per share mainly depends on the issuing company’ s earnings and on its dividend policy. In case of profits or losses, dividend payments may be reduced or not made at all.

                <h3> <i class="fas fa-check-circle fa-sm"></i> Fixed income</h3>
                   <p  class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">Fixed Income Securities are negotiable debt instruments issued in bearer or registered form by an issuer to creditors whose duration, terms and interest payments may vary depending on their terms. The purchaser of Fixed Income Securities (the creditor) has a claim against the issuer (the debtor).
                   </p>
                   <p  class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">Fixed Income Securities are subject to credit risk. Credit risk is the possibility that an issuer will fail to make timely payments of interest or principal. Some issuers may not make payments on debt Securities causing a loss. Or an issuer may suffer adverse changes in its financial condition that could lower the credit quality of a security, leading to greater volatility in the price of the security. A change in the quality rating of a bond or other security can also affect the security’ s liquidity and make it more difficult to sell. The lower quality fixed income Securities in which the Client may invest are more susceptible to these problems than higher quality obligations.</p>
                   <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">Fixed Income Securities are subject to prepayment risk. The issuers of Fixed Income Securities held in the Customer’ s Portfolio may not be able to prepay principal due on the Securities, particularly during periods of declining interest rates. Renaissance, if so, requested by the Client, may not be able to reinvest that principal at attractive rates, reducing the income. On the other hand, rising interest rates may cause prepayments to occur at slower than expected rates. This effectively lengthens the maturities of the affected Securities, making them more sensitive to interest rate changes and the value of Securities held more volatile.
                   </p>
                   <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">The Client acknowledges that lower rated debt Securities are subject to additional risks. Lower rated debt Securities, including securities commonly referred to as “junk bonds”, are very risky because the issuers may fail to make payments of interest and principal. Part of the reason for this high risk is that, in the event of a default or bankruptcy, holders of lower rated debt securities generally will not receive payments until the holders of all other debt have been paid. In addition, the market for lower rated debt securities has in the past been more volatile than the markets for other securities. Lower rated debt securities are also often less liquid than higher rated debt securities.</p>
                   <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">The Client acknowledges that sovereign debt securities are subject to significant risk that under some political, diplomatic, social or economic circumstances may lead some developing countries that issue lower-quality debt securities to be unable or unwilling to make principal or interest repayments as they become due. Additional risks may be associated with certain types of bonds, for example, floating rate notes, reverse floating rate notes, zero bonds, foreign currency bonds, convertible bonds, indexed bonds, and subordinated bonds. For such bonds, you should make inquiries about the risks referred to in the issuance prospectus and not to purchase such securities before being certain that all risks are fully understood. In the case of subordinated bonds, you should enquire about the ranking of the debenture compared to the issuer’ s other debentures. Indeed, if the issuer becomes bankrupt, those bonds will only be redeemed after payment of all higher ranked creditors. In the case of reverse convertible notes, there is a risk that you will not be entirely reimbursed, but will receive only an amount equivalent to the underlying securities at maturity.</p>

            <div class="uk-width-1-1@m">
                <h3> <i class="fas fa-check-circle fa-sm"></i> Futures</h3>
                   <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">Transactions in futures involve the obligation to make, or to take, delivery of the underlying asset of the contract at a future date, or in some cases to settle the position with cash. They carry a high degree of risk. The ‘gearing’ or ‘leverage’ often obtainable in futures trading means that a small deposit or down payment can lead to large losses as well as gains. It also means that a relatively small movement can lead to a proportionately much larger movement in the value of your investment, and this can work against you as well as for you. Futures transactions have a contingent liability, and you should be aware of the implications of this, in particular the margining requirements, which are set out below.

            <div class="uk-width-1-1@m">
                <h3> <i class="fas fa-check-circle fa-sm"></i> Options</h3>
                   <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">There are many different types of options with different characteristics subject to the following conditions.
                   </p>
                   <ol style=" list-style-type: lower-alpha">
                    <li class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta uk-margin-bottom"> Buying options: Buying options usually involves less risk than selling options because, if the price of the underlying asset moves against you, you  can simply 	allow the option to lapse. The maximum loss is limited to the premium, plus any 	commission or other transaction charges. However, if you buy a call option on a futures 	contract and you later exercise the option, you will acquire the future. This will expose 	you to the risks described under ‘Futures’.
                    </li>
                    <li class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta uk-margin-bottom"> Writing options: If you write an option, the risk involved is considerably greater than 	buying options. You may be liable for margin to maintain your position and a loss may be 	sustained well in excess of the premium received. By writing an option, you accept a legal 	obligation to purchase or sell the underlying asset if the option is exercised against you, 	however far the market price has moved away from the exercise price. If you already own 	the underlying asset which you have contracted to sell (when the options will be known 	as ‘covered call options’ ) the risk is reduced. If you do not own the underlying asset 	( ‘uncovered call options’ ) the risk can be unlimited. Only experienced persons should 	contemplate writing uncovered options, and then only after securing full details of the 	applicable conditions and potential risk exposure.
                    </li>
                    <li class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">Traditional options: Traditional options may involve greater risk than other options. 	Two-way prices are not usually quoted and there is no Exchange market on which to 	close out an open position or to affect an equal and opposite transaction to reverse an 	open position. It may be difficult to assess its value or for the seller of such an option to 	manage his exposure to risk. Certain options markets operate on a margin-ed basis, 	under which buyers do not pay the full premium on their option at the time they 	purchase it. In this situation, you may subsequently be called upon to pay margin on the 	option up to the level of your premium. If you fail to do so as required, your position may 	be closed or liquidated in the same way as a futures position.

                   <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">Futures and options contracts can also be referred to as contracts for differences. These can be options and futures on any index, as well as currency and interest rate swaps. 	However, unlike other futures and options, these contracts can only be settled in cash. 	Investing in a contract for differences carries the same risks as investing in a future or an 	option and you should be aware of these as set out above. Transactions in contracts for 	differences may also have a contingent liability and you should be aware of the implications of detailed below.
