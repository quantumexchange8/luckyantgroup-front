                        must deposit cash to secure performance of their obligations under the contract. The
                        Client acknowledges that all transactions are subject to and comply with the prevailing
                        Market Rules, which typically include broad powers in emergency or undesirable

                    <li>Futures</li>
                    <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">Transactions in futures involve the obligation to make, or take delivery of the
                        underlying asset of the contract at a future date, or in some cases to settle your
                        position with cash. They carry a high degree of risk. The “gearing” or “leverage” often
                        obtainable in futures trading means that a small deposit or down payment can lead to
                        large losses as well as gains. It also means that a relatively small market movement
                        can lead to a proportionally much larger movement in the value of your investment, and this can work against you as well as for you. Futures transactions have a
                        contingent liability and you should be aware of the implications of this, in particular the
                        margining requirement.</p>

                        These can be options and/or futures on the FTSE 100 index or any other index or
                        share, commodity or currency. However, unlike other futures and options, these
                        contracts can only be settled in cash. Investing in contracts for difference carries the
                        same risks as investing in a future or an option and you should be aware of these as
                        set out in paragraphs A respectively. Transactions in contracts for difference may also

                        enter into any contract. Our rolling spot contracts and CFDs are based on highly

                        very high degree of risk, and trading such instruments may expose the investor to
                        substantial losses as well as gains. The gearing and leverage that are obtainable with
                        CFD trading mean that you only need to place a small deposit to commence trading
                        with us, although this small deposit may result in large losses or large gains. You must
                        consider that if the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater

                        you. We will assess your application from the information available to us and, in
                        particular, the responses you have given in completing the Customer Information
                        Sheet; if you are accepted as a customer, it will be on such a basis. Accordingly, we
                        will classify you as a private customer. You should not proceed with this arrangement
                        unless you have carefully considered that it is appropriate for you and are satisfied
                        with these terms. Investors should note that to protect their interests, we may set zero
                        stop orders where no client order has been placed to minimize losses. In this event, clients cannot lose more than their initial commitment. </p>

                    <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">We provide herewith a summary of the policy we maintain in order to manage conflicts
                        of interest in respect of the duties we owe to our clients.</p>
                    <h6>General</h6>
                    <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">A conflict of interest can arise between LUCKY ANT and you as a client or between
                        your interests and those of another client of ours. We aim to establish, maintain, and
                        operate effective organizational and administrative arrangements with a view to taking
                        all reasonable steps to prevent conflicts of interest from constituting or giving rise to a
                        material risk of damage to the interests of our clients. </p>
                    <h6>Our Policy</h6>
                    <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">We aim to keep a record of the kinds of activity we carry on in which a material conflict
                        could arise or has arisen, and, in doing so, we take account of the activities of other members of our group of companies. We also maintain procedures to ensure
                        appropriate independence between members of our staff who are involved in different
                        activities. This includes the operation of information barriers, the segregation of duties
                        and responsibilities, and the maintenance of a policy of independence that requires
                        our staff, when providing services to a client, to act in the best interests of the client
                        and to disregard any conflicts of interest. In some circumstances, we may decline to
                        act for a client or potential client.</p>
                    <h6>Disclosure : General</h6>
                    <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">Where our arrangements to manage conflicts are not or cannot be sufficient to
                        reasonably assure that risks of damage to a client’s interest will be prevented, we aim
                        to disclose the general nature and/or sources of conflicts before carrying on business
                        for the client. This is to allow the client to consider whether to ask for more information
                        and whether to continue with the service; we do not aim to provide detailed, highly
                        specific, or comprehensive information.</p>
                    <h6>Gift & Hospitality</h6>
                    <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">We do not prohibit our staff from receiving small gifts and minor hospitality from other
                        parties with which we do business but only where in the opinion of a director or senior
                        manager it is at a level that is not lavish or excessive and only where it will not impair
                        our duty to act in the best interests of our clients or other legal or regulatory
                        obligations.</p>

                    <p class="uk-text-justify uk-text-meta">Our rolling spot contracts and CFDs involve highly leveraged margin trading. These
                        derivative instruments carry a significant level of risk, and trading them may result in
                        substantial losses or gains. The information on this site and the services we offer are
                        intended for experienced investors with sufficient financial resources to engage in
                        trading our investment products. To protect client interests, we may implement zero
                        stop orders in the absence of client orders to minimize losses. In such cases, clients
                        typically cannot lose more than their initial investment in a specific transaction. </p>
